# Knowledge

Life, the universe, and everything

Collection of useful tidbits accumulated over the years. This is my attempt to start collating info from numerous different places into a single repository. Time will tell if it’s successful – or if I just end up with one more place where I keep information… : )

My name is pronounced `ˈterɔ`. (The [IPA Reader](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=ˈterɔ) gives an approximation that is almost but not completely unlike it is supposed to be.)

## Latest Updates

Just testing out some stuff here… (still fiddling…)

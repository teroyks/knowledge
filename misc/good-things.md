# Good Things

This is a miscellaneous collection of things that I’ve found make my life better.
Not a comprehensive list, nor organized in any particular manner.

A buckwheat hull pillow. Quite different from a traditional pillow: it’s not mushy, you can mold it how you want and it keeps the shape. It breathes better than a pillow filled with either down and feathers or synthetic equivalent which makes it much less sweaty in the summer. I’m using a pillow from [Tattariina](https://www.tattariina.fi/epages/tattariina.sf/fi_FI/?ObjectPath=/Shops/2016091701/Categories/Akanatyynyt/Aikuisten_akanatyyny_iso)

Magnetic status indicator for diswashing machine. Double-sided magnet makes this a handy daily helper. This one from [SunnyMore Design](https://www.sunnymoredesign.fi/tuote/arjen-apuri-magneetti/) is designed and manufactured from plywood in Finland.

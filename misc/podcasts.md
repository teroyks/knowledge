# Podcasts

## Development

[Koodarikuiskaaja](https://koodarikuiskaaja.fi/podcast/) (in Finnish) – An interview podcast in the space between technology and humans: communication, learning, teamwork, etc. Lots of interesting guests, always provides food for thought.

[Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) – Front end development course gurus Wes & Scott have interesting discussions about developing, tech, and whatever comes to mind. They are adorable and very entertaining even when they venture into areas that they know considerably less (such as backend or command line tools).

## Technology

[Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/) – “Three nerds discussing tech, Apple, programming, and loosely related matters.” This is one of my favorite banter podcasts. There’s usually insightful commentary on the tech world (especially Apple) but also whatever comes to mind, e.g. games, cars, family, and entertaining fuckups that happened to one of the hosts (usually Casey).

[The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/) – John Gruber and a guest discuss latest events in the tech world (mostly Apple), sports, movies, etc. Always a good listen. Gruber is one of the tech world’s most insightful commentators, and he has a very good rapport with his guests, making the chats very enjoyable.

## Movies

[Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvdrj) – Wittertainment at its wittertainiest. Mark Kermode is my favorite movie critic: insightful, funny, versatile, with vast knowledge of the world of cinema. And not above getting into silly bickering with co-host Mayo or every now and then launching into an epic rant about something or other.

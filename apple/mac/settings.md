# My Mac Settings

These are some of the settings I like to configure for my Macs. Some are done with [BetterTouchTool](bettertouchtool.md), some with [Alfred](alfred/README.md), and some with standard Mac settings.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- ⇪: [Act as Hyper Key ✧](bettertouchtool.md#caps-lock-as-hyper-key)
- ⌘Space: Alfred
- ✧Space: Alfred Snippet
- ⇧⌃Space: Open Fantastical Mini Window
- ⇧⌥Space: Spotlight Search
- ✧C: Toggle Caps Lock
- ✧S: Start Screen Saver
- ✧V: Show Pastebot Clipboard
- ⇧⌥⌘←: Move Window Left
- ⇧⌥⌘→: Move Window Right

## Safari

### Settings

- *General > Open “safe” files after downloading*: disable to never automatically open files without asking

### Useful Extensions

- Hush: closes cookie notifications etc.
- JSON Peep: view JSON in a readable format
- StopTheMadness: disables web page shenanigans (such as “prevent copying”)

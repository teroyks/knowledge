# BetterTouchTool

[BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai) is a Mac app that can customize input devices (remap keyboard shortcuts, mouse gestures, Touchbar, and much more).

## Caps Lock as Hyper Key

In version 3.540 (Jan 2021), you can make Caps Lock act as a Hyper Key (press all modifier keys at once).

Update: BetterTouchTool seems a bit flakey for mapping the Hyper key â€“ a dedicated app (HyperKey or its big brother SuperKey) seems to be working better.

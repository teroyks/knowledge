# Apple Photos App

To stop `photoanalysisd` from running in the background (on a computer you don’t want the advanced Photos features):

1. Go to Preferences > General in Photos.
2. Uncheck the boxes in the _Memories_ section.

(from [StackExchange](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/310594/what-is-photoanalysisd-and-why-is-it-using-77-of-my-cpu/378557#378557)) – does not seem to always work.

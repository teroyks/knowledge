# Image Handling on a Mac

## Preview

The built-in Preview app can handle many basic image processing tasks, such as:

- resizing
- format conversion
- markup (adjust colors, add text and simple shapes, sign, etc.)

## Batch Processing

The command-line tool `sips` ([Scriptable image prosessing system](https://ss64.com/osx/sips.html)) is a versatile tool for querying or modifying raster images and color profiles.

- [example function](../../programming/fish/functions/img-pad-width.fish) that pads an image with white to a given width while preserving height

# Misc. iPhone Stuff

## Settings

Just a few things to make the phone nicer to use (YMMV of course):

- Accessibility > Touch > Haptic Touch > Fast – reveal previews etc. with a shorter touch (iOS 17)
- Camera > Formats > Pro Default > HEIF Max – Up to 48 MBP resolution but takes up lot less space than ProRAW
- Passwords > Password Options > Verification Codes > Clean Up Automatically – automatically delete verification code after inserting with autofill
- Safari > Advanced > Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection > All Browsing – will strip tracking information from URLs

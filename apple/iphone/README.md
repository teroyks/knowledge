# Misc. iPhone Stuff

## Settings

Just a few things to make the phone nicer to use (YMMV of course):

- Accessibility > Touch > Haptic Touch > Fast – reveal previews etc. with a shorter touch (iOS 17)

## Security

- [iOS recovery key](./iOS%20recovery%20key.md)

## Interesting Apps

- [Scorecard](https://www.getscorecard.app) – track scores in games

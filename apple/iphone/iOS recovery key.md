# iOS Recovery Key

You can create a recovery key that lets you recover access to an Apple ID account with two-factor authentication when the password stops working (or you forget it) or your account is locked without having to contact Apple.

*Note: after activating the recovery key, it is the only way to recover access: Apple cannot do it for you any more.*

# Connect Headphones with NFC

Tested with my Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds, should work equelly well with other NFC-equipped headphones.

Prerequisites:

The Bluetooth device must be paired and connected to the iPhone when setting up the automation.

1. Open the [Shortcuts app](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) and go to the _Automations_ tab.
2. Click on `+` on the upper right corner and click on ‘Create Personal Automation’.
3. Scroll down to `NFC` and tap on it. Click on `Scan` and when prompted, touch the NFC device with the top edge of the iPhone.
4. Enter a name for this NFC device when prompted and click `Next`.
5. Click to add an action, choose a script action, and select AirPlay playback destination from the list.
6. Change the destination from `iPhone` to the connected headphones.
7. (Optional) set `ask before running` off at the next step.

After this, you can connect to your headphones just by touching them with the top of your phone. This works even if the headphones are currently connected to another device.

# Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a notes taking / knowledge base program, “a second brain for you”. It has a wiki-like way of easily linking [Markdown](https://obsidian-rs.github.io/docs/doc1/ "Obsidian Style Guide") pages together, and supports a plugin system for expanding the functionality.

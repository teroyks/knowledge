# Writings

I plan to eventually collect some of the articles, blog posts. etc. I’ve written about fandom along the years here.

- [Guest blogging at Jeff Vandermeer’s place](./ecstatic-days/README.md) (2008)
- [I was interviewed by Jeff](./ecstatic-days/interview.md) (2011)
- [Reminiscing about Åcon](acon-x.md) in the Åcon X program book (2019)
- [My old blog](http://partialrecall.blogspot.com/) (not active any more but has over a decade’s worth of posts)
- A long time ago, [I dabbled a bit with filk](./filk/README.md)

# Yes Sir, I’m a Wookiee

Tune: Yes Sir, I Can Boogie (Baccara)  
Lyrics © Tero Ykspetäjä, 1996

Mister,  
Your eyes are full of hesitation.  
Sure makes me wonder  
if you know what you’re looking at.

Maybe  
you didn’t know my reputation.  
So just remember,  
you really shouldn’t make me mad.

Yes sir, I’m a wookiee.  
  When I talk it’s just a growl.  
I’m a wookiee, boogie wookiee,  
  I smell foul.

Yes sir, I’m a wookiee.  
  To me humans look so small.  
I’m a wookiee, boogie wookiee,  
  eight feet tall.

So, sir,  
Darth Vader put my buddy on ice.  
No, that was not nice.  
I miss him so I think I’ll die.

But sir,  
We will free him from Jabba’s palace.  
Our leader Luke is  
a very powerful Jedi.

Yes sir, I’m a wookiee.  
  When I talk…

Yes sir, I’m a wookiee.  
  To me humans…

Yes sir, I’m a wookiee.  
  To me humans…

Yes sir, I’m a wookiee.  
  When I talk…

Yes sir, I’m a wookiee (I’m a wookiee).  
  To me humans look so small.  
I’m a wookiee (I’m a wookiee),  
  boogie wookiee (boogie wookiee),  
  eight feet tall.

Yes sir, I’m a wookiee (I’m a wookiee).  
  To me humans look so small.  
I’m a wookiee (I’m a wookiee),  
  boogie wookiee (ooooo……),  
  eight feet tall.

Yes sir, I’m a wookiee.  
  To me humans look so small.  
I’m a wookiee, boogie wookiee,  
  eight feet tall.

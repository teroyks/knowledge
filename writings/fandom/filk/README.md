# Filk

[“Filking”](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Filk "Definition of filk on Fanlore") is what Fandom circles call singing your own (sfnal, often but not always funny) lyrics on top of known songs. I heard serious filking for the first time at [Intersection](https://fanac.org/Intersection/), the 1995 Worldcon in Glasgow, and it inspired me to write a couple of lyrics myself.

- [I Have a Team](./i-have-a-team.md) (Star Trek)
- [Hasta La Vista](./hasta-la-vista.md) (Terminator)
- [Yes Sir, I’m a Wookiee](./yes-sir-im-a-wookiee.md) (Star Wars)

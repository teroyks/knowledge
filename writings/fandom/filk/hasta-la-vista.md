# Hasta La Vista

Tune: Hasta Mañana (Abba)  
Lyrics © Tero Ykspetäjä, 1995

I lost the trail of my target,  
I tried to shoot, but missed.  
Where did you go?  
I just don’t know.  
But still my hunt for you will live forever.

Hasta la vista, baby, I’ll be back  
Don’t know where, don’t know when.  
Just keep in mind that you are going to die.  
Some day for you there will be no tomorrow.

Hasta la vista, we will meet again.  
They must do without you.  
I don’t forget, I come from the future.  
I can’t forgive, just wanna shoot you.  
Hasta la vista baby,  
Hasta la vista until then.

What is the dream you were dreaming,  
Where all the kids got killed?  
Life isn’t fair,  
but I don’t care.  
And I shall kill you as soon as I find you.

Hasta la vista, baby, I’ll be back…

Hasta la vista, we will meet again…

Hasta la vista, we will meet again…

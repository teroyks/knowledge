# I Have a Team

Tune: I Have a Dream (Abba)  
Lyrics © Tero Ykspetäjä, 1995

I have a team  
  that’s tough and mean.  
They help me cope  
  with anything.  
If I see a danger  
  when we are away,  
I just signal Scotty,  
  Beam us up again.

I believe in Starfleet  
  something good in everyone I see.  
I believe in Starfleet  
  but if they start making threats to me,  
I’ll kill the fiend  
  with phaser beam.

My life’s a dream,  
  a fantasy  
to help you through  
  reality.  
And my destination  
  is to boldly go  
through the final frontier  
  in this stupid show.

I believe in Starfleet  
  something good in everyone I see.  
I believe in Starfleet  
  but if they start making threats to me,  
I’ll kill the fiend  
  with phaser beam  
I’ll kill the fiend  
  with phaser beam

I have a team…

I believe in Starfleet…

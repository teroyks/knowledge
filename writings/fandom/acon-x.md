# Reminiscing

_published in the [Åcon X](https://aconten.wordpress.com) program book, May 2019_

Swecon, sometimes in the early 2000s. Swecons are always great fun, so too was this one which included things like sitting at a banquet table with some friends, the foreign actor guest doing rounds of being a good pr person, stopping to chat with us for quite a long time, his handlers getting ever more desperate trying to wrangle him back to his scheduled appearance and us smiling politely like we didn't completely disagree with his opinions, and later getting enthusiastically ignored by Dave Lally in the middle of a chat because a couple of young women happened to pass by. 

Back from Swecon. The Ferry Experience. Not enough booze in the world to dull the goddamn karaoke everywhere. We escaped to the deck and managed to woo the bar lady to agree to give us glass pints instead of plastic mugs to take with even though she was concerned about the apparently very real threat of a helicopter not being able to land in the middle of a medical evacuation because we would undoubtedly litter the whole deck with broken glass. 

The ferry passing Åland, only stopping just enough to circumvent paying proper tax on all the booze and tobacco sold to the karaoke crowds. Us on the deck, looking at Mariehamn and saying to each other, that sure looks like a quaint little town, I bet it would be fun to organize a convention there. A fun thought experiment that surely would not create anything tangible.

Then somebody went and talked to Eemeli. 

Booking a hotel. Not as cheap as we thought it would be (something to do with a tourist town and tourist season, or some such nonsense) but not unreasonable either, and seemed very friendly and happy to host us. We had a place. This thing was becoming real.

I vaguely remember sitting in some pub in Helsinki with my co-conspirators, arguing about who to invite as our first Guest of Honor. No idea who first suggested Hal Duncan but he set the bar incredibly high for the Åcon Guests of Honor to come. Reading fancy, poetic stuff, his sometimes understandable accent making it even more mythical. Giving an enthusiastic INFERNOKRUSHER presentation. Staying up all night every night drinking, chatting, performing a musical.

Many other brilliant guests to come at later incarnations of the convention, most of them gloriously living up to the expected GoH standards, each in their own ways. (If you are an ex-GoH reading this, YOU most definitely did!)

Creating that first con, thinking it would be a relaxacon (my autocorrect tries to change that into “real Åcon” which seems apt) and nobody would care about the program, yet putting together what would become the signature Åcon mix of erudition, light fluff, and general silliness, with such success that the program room was packed for most of the convention.

Pizza. With banana slices. Ham and banana salad. Banana beer. Sensing a theme here.

Bar closing the first night of the convention at nine because it was a holiday and nobody realized there would be a horde of thirsty devourers of books and bheer at the hotel that night. Drinking the pub empty of all but the drabbest lager on tap because nobody realized there would be a horde of thirsty devourers of books and bheer at the hotel that night. (“They even drank all the weird stuff nobody else wanted to touch!” exclaimed the barkeep.) The start of a beautiful friendship, carefully cultivated year after year, slowly inching towards the bar ordering what we told them to order, or at least some approximation of it.

Excursions. Let's not get cooped up at the hotel from dusk till dawn, let's start the programming in the afternoon and go see interesting places on the islands. Brewery trip. The lovely Mercedes and her sublime chocolate. Castles and pirate ships and bookstores oh my!

Painting people pink, green, blue. Taking pictures.

Another Åcon, another success. And another, and another. Archipelacon – making a real convention, with many guests and hundreds of people. Award-winning cultural goodness. Getting back to the cosy roots of a bunch of friends together in a hotel, drinking beers and chatting about science fiction. Agreeing that Åcon is perfect and should never change. A stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet, and this goes double for those attending this fun little thingy we started years ago. Love you all!

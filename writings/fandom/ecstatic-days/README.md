# Ecstatic Days

In 2008, I did a [guest blogging stint](https://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2008/11/02/jukka-halme-and-tero-ykspetaja-guest-blogging-on-ecstatic-days-nov-3-7/) at Jeff VanderMeer’s blog (then called Ecstatic Days) together with [Jukka Halme](https://eatingmuffins.typepad.com/ "Jukka’s blog"). I’ve collected my own stuff here, and linked to the others.

- [Hello, World!](./hello-world.md) (Introduction)
- [Finnish Fandom: An Overview](./finnish-fandom-overview.md)
- [Finnish Fandom: Conventions](./finnish-fandom-conventions.md)
- [Sticking Together](./sticking-together.md) (about helping a friend in need)
- [Global Storytelling](./global-storytelling.md) (a review of The Sands of Sarasvati graphic novel)
- [Finnish Fandom: Fanzines](./finnish-fandom-fanzines.md)
- [Top Five Reasons Why Finnish Is Cooler Than English](./top-five-reasons-why-finnish-is-cooler-than-english.md) (of course, after writing a few serious posts with lots of info, some research, useful links, etc., the most attention received a more-than-a-little tongue-in-cheek post, written quickly after getting home from a pub night. This one got comments [the next year](https://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2009/01/02/finnish-cooler-than-english-and-what-else/), and even a couple of years later, and was also apparently deemed interesting enough to be ~~stolen~~ quoted in its entirety by some US paper—the Los Angeles Post if memory serves)
- [Safe Nest No More](./safe-nest-no-more.md) (about a couple of recent, but thankfully rare, school shootings in Finland)
- [The Joy of Fanzines](./the-joy-of-fanzines.md)
- [Finnish Fandom: Further Reading](./finnish-fandom-further-reading.md)

# Hello, World!

Hi, my name is Tero, and I’ll be one half of your Jeff substitute this week. (Not that I would ever pretend to be able to produce even close to half of his output, neither in quality nor quantity, on the best of days. But you’re half-stuck with me anyway, so here goes.)

So, a quick introduction. As Jeff mentioned, I’m an sf fan, fanzine editor and occasional conrunner from Finland. I live in Turku, the oldest city (and ~~one of~~ the most beautiful) in Finland with my family (which means my wife, daughter, and our two parakeets). By day I work in IT (currently with integrated circuit design environments), but by night I ~~don my cape~~ turn on my reading light to dive into the wonderful world of science fiction and fandom.

I found science fiction early on (pretty close to the ideal age of ten, I think). Some years later I found organized fandom and immediately knew I was home. I’ve made a lot of friends, shared countless fascinating conversations with them over an equally countless amount of beers, gone to conventions both in Finland and abroad (and helped organize a couple of them), and even met my wife through fandom. So it’s a subject very close to my heart, and something I’ll be talking about this week. I welcome your comments, and if you have any questions about the Finnish fandom or sf in Finland in general, I’d be happy to answer them in the comments section!
